/*! \class OutputTimer_c
 \brief The OutputTimer class is responsible for taking decisions related to output timing

 This class is used to generate output timing information for decoded buffers, handling avsync
 (through use of the OutputCoordinator), for managing frame drop due to late decode, trick mode
 execution and playlist presentation intervals.

 The partial list of meta data types used by this class :-

 Attached to input buffers :-

 - ParsedFrameParameters Describes the frame to be manifested.
 - Parsed[Video|Audio|Data]Parameters providing input to the
 allow generation of stream type specific timing input
 to the manifestation process.

 Added to output buffers :-

 - [Video|Audio|Data]OutputTiming Describes the output timing
 to be applied to manifestation of the frame.

/*! \fn OutputTimerStatus_t OutputTimer_c::RegisterOutputCoordinator(OutputCoordinator_t OutputCoordinator);
 \brief Specify the output coordinator.

 This call provides the OutputCoordinator to the OutputTimer, the timer makes use
 of the OutputCoordinator to tie together the presentation times of the separate
 streams of a playback.

 Calling this function provokes critical actions within the OutputTimer, it will
 register itself with the OutputCoordinator, and is expected to be in a running
 state after the call, that is it should be ready to accept buffers for timing,
 and other function calls.

 \param OutputCoordinator A pointer to an instance of an OutputCoordinator_c class.

 \return OutputTimer status code, OutputTimerNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputTimerStatus_t OutputTimer_c::ResetTimeMapping( void )
 \brief Invalidate the playback/system time mapping.

 This function invalidates the mapping between system and playback times, for the stream.
 It makes it impossible
 to obtain translations between system and playback times on the stream until a new mapping has been established.

 A new mapping may be established by synchronizing the streams of a playback, or by
 imposing a mapping from the application.

 \return OutputTimer status code, OutputTimerNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputTimerStatus_t OutputTimer_c::AwaitEntryIntoDecodeWindow(Buffer_t Buffer)
 \brief perform a process wait until entry to the decode window.

 Calling this function will perform a process sleep until entry into a decode window
 for the specified buffer, if certain conditions are met. The conditions are first that
 a decode window is specified, or can be deduced, second that the window has no already
 been entered and third that the window is not an unreasonable distance in the future.

 A decode window is specified if the 'NormalizedDecodeTime' field in the 'parsedFrameParameters',
 associated with the buffer, is not 'INVALID_TIME'. It can be deduced when this is not the case,
 only if the buffer contains a non-reference frame, by applying an offset to the
 'NormalizedPlaybackTime' if it is not INVALID_TIME' (which it should not be at this point
 for a non-reference frame).

 The test for an unreasonable distance in the future, will involve comparing the distance to
 the decode window gains a value involving (a constant X frame duration)/Speed.

 Any wait will abort should the output timer be halted, or the speed changed.

 \param Buffer A pointer to a buffer instance whose decode window we are waiting for.

 \return OutputTimer status code, OutputTimerNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputTimerStatus_t OutputTimer_c::TestForFrameDrop(Buffer_t Buffer, OutputTimerTestPoint_t TestPoint)
 \brief Test a buffer to see if it should be dropped

 During play, a buffer may be dropped at one of several points, this function
 is responsible for making the decision to drop a frame.

 Before decode, a buffer can only be be dropped if it is a non-reference frame and :-

 - The current trick mode will not manifest it.
 - The current time is close to or after the presentation time, so it will not decode
 in time to present it.

 After decode, reference frames also can be dropped (though this will only drop the presentation),
 the reasons why a frame may be dropped are as above.

 \param Buffer A pointer to a buffer instance containing the coded frame (before decode),
 or decoded frame (after decode) under consideration.
 \param TestPoint An enumerated value indicating the point at which the drop is being tested.

 \return OutputTimer status code, OutputTimerNoError indicates do not drop the frame,
 other statuses may indicate a fault, or the reason the frame is to be dropped.
*/

/*! \fn OutputTimerStatus_t OutputTimer_c::GenerateFrameTiming( Buffer_t Buffer )
 \brief Generate the output timing information for a frame.

 This function takes a frame and fills out the [Video|Audio|Data]OutputTiming structure
 attached to the buffer.

 This function makes use of the OutputCoordinator to obtain the mapping between playback time
 and system time, when no mapping has been established, this function may block while waiting
 for the mapping to be established, this block will occur within the OutputCoordinator_c::SynchronizeStreams().

 \param Buffer A pointer to a buffer instance containing the
 decoded frame under consideration.

 \return OutputTimer status code, OutputTimerNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputTimerStatus_t OutputTimer_c::RecordActualFrameTiming( Buffer_t Buffer )
 \brief Record the actual time a frame was manifested.

 This function is responsible for recording the actual time a frame was manifested, and
 the length of time it spent being manifested. It is by comparing these times with the
 calculated times and adjusting future calculations that avsync will be achieved.

 \return OutputTimer status code, OutputTimerNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputTimerStatus_t OutputTimer_c::GetStreamStartDelay( unsigned long long *Delay );
 \brief Find the delay between the start of this stream and the earliest starting stream in the playback.

 This function is provided to support throttling of data injection into the player.

 \param Delay The deduced delay value.

 \return OutputTimer status code, OutputTimerNoError should be returned if the delay value is valid.
