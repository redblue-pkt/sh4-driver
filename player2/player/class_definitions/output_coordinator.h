/*! \class OutputCoordinator_c
 \brief The OutputCoordinator class is responsible for coordinating the output timing of streams in a playback

 This class is used to tie together the mappings between system time and playback time for the
 streams that make up a playback. It handles the establishment of that mapping whether by an imposed
 external setting (application level), or by synchronizing the start of a number of streams.

 This class uses a context to identify the specific stream, and to hold the mapping in force on each stream.

 This class makes no use of buffers or of meta data attached to buffers.

 Some notes on time mappings.

 Time mappings global mappings for a playback, but have local, stream specific, aspects. A playback will move
 from one time mapping to another one when a discontinuity is encountered within a playback. Since different
 streams within a playback will have the discontinuity pass through timing functions at different (though closely
 spaced) times, different streams will transition between time mappings at different times. Through careful management
 of the context associated with a stream, and the implementation of the synchronize function, the output coordinator
 must manage these phased transitions. In addition it is necessary for the functions that translate between time domains
 to know which stream the translation is for (since the same playback time may generate completely different system
 times, depending on which mapping is in force).

*/

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::RegisterStream( PlayerStream_t Stream,
 PlayerStreamType_t StreamType,
 OutputCoordinatorContext_t *Context );
 \brief Register a stream to the OutputCoordinator.

 This call informs the coordinator of a stream that is to be coordinated, and of the nature of that
 stream, and obtains a context used to identify stream specific coordination information.

 Different policies, that may be in force in the player, affect the way in which different stream types
 (audio/video/data) are handled in terms of synchronization etc... It is important then that the coordinator
 is aware of the type of a stream.

 \param Stream The stream to be coordinated.
 \param StreamType An indicator of the nature of the stream.
 \param Context A pointer to a returned context identifier

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::DeRegisterStream(OutputCoordinatorContext_t Context );
 \brief Remove a stream from consideration by the OutputCoordinator.

 Calling this function will remove the specified stream, identified by Context, from consideration by the OutputCoordinator.

 \param Context Identifier for the context of the stream to be removed from consideration.

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::SetPlaybackSpeed(OutputCoordinatorContext_t Context,
 Rational_t Speed,
 PlayDirection_t Direction );
 \brief Inform the OutputCoordinator of a new playback speed and direction.

 The playback speed affects the relative rate at which playback time passes with respect
 to system time, and directly affects the mapping of playback times to system times. In
 addition the setting of a new playback speed will abort any attempt to synchronize streams
 for startup. Initially only the PlaybackContext will be allowed as the Context identifier,
 if we ever get to understand the meaning of having different speeds for different streams we may allow
 stream specific speed setting.

 \param Context Identifier for the context of the stream.
 \param Speed A scalar value representing the speed of playback. FIX(1) represents normal speed.
 \param Direction The direction of playback (forward/reverse).

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::ResetTimeMapping( OutputCoordinatorContext_t Context )
 \brief Invalidate the playback/system time mapping.

 This function invalidates the mapping between system and playback times, for one stream, or for the whole playback.
 It makes it impossible
 to obtain translations between system and playback times until a new mapping has been established.

 A new mapping may be established by synchronizing the streams of a playback, or by
 imposing a mapping from the application.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::EstablishTimeMapping( OutputCoordinatorContext_t Context,
 unsigned long long NormalizedPlaybackTime,
 unsigned long long SystemTime = INVALID_TIME );
 \brief Impose a playback/system time mapping.

 This function allows the external application to impose a system/playback time mapping by
 identifying a system time and playback time that are synchronous. If the system time is
 specified as 'INVALID_TIME', then the current system time is used.

 It is anticipated that Context will be PlaybackContext.

 It should be noted that the specification of a synchronous point forms only one part of
 the mapping, the complete mapping is specified by the identification of a synchronous point,
 plus a scaling factor which is the Speed of playback (or its' inverse).

 Due to the nature of elapsing time, in order to guarantee a specific mapping it is important
 to specify the speed before specifying the synchronous point.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.
 \param NormalizedPlaybackTime A playback time.
 \param SystemTime The system time with which it is synchronous.

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success.

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::TranslatePlaybackTimeToSystem(

 \brief Translate a playback time to a system time.

 Apply the playback to system time mapping to the specified playback time.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.
 \param NormalizedPlaybackTime A playback time.
 \param SystemTime A pointer to a variable to hold the mapped playback time.

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success,
 OutputCoordinatorMappingNotEstablished indicates that no mapping has yet been established.

*/

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::SynchronizeStreams( OutputCoordinatorContext_t Context,
 unsigned long long NormalizedPlaybackTime,
 unsigned long long NormalizedDecodeTime,
 unsigned long long *SystemTime );
 \brief Establish a time mapping based on stream content.

 This function is responsible for establishing a time mapping and performing startup
 synchronization for all of the currently registered streams. It waits until all the
 streams have entered this function before establishing a mapping based on the stream
 with the earliest playback time.

 Also on entry each stream is delayed to allow sufficient frames to be decoded to allow
 smooth playback on return from this function.

 The function can establish a mapping based on a subset of the streams, if not all
 streams have entered the function within a reasonable time period, currently
 defined as a constant.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.
 \param NormalizedPlaybackTime The normalized playback time that it is attempting to synchronize.
 \param NormalizedDecodeTime The normalized decode time of the frame that it is attempting to synchronize.
 \param SystemTime A pointer to a variable to hold the mapped playback time, when the mapping is established.

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success.
*/

/*! \fn OutputCoordinatorStatus_t OutputCoordinator_c::PerformEntryIntoDecodeWindowWait(
 OutputCoordinatorContext_t Context,
 unsigned long long NormalizedDecodeTime,
 unsigned long long DecodeWindowPorch,
 unsigned long long MaximumAllowedSleepTime );
 \brief Wait until we enter the decode window for a frame.

 This function is responsible for performing the wait until entry into the decode
 window, this will commence
 a time 'DecodeWindowPorch' micro seconds before the system time
 associated with the 'NormalizedDecodeTime', applying a sensible maximum
 wait time defined by 'MaximumAllowedSleepTime' scaled by the speed at
 which we are playing. The wait for entry can be aborted on one of
 several conditions including a loss of time mapping (in which case there
 is no system time associated with the decode time) or a change of speed
 (in which case the maximum sleep time changes meaning).

 \param Context Stream context identifier.
 \param NormalizedDecodeTime The normalized decode time of the window we will await entry to.
 \param DecodeWindowPorch The time, in micro seconds, before the decode time at which the window starts.
 \param MaximumAllowedSleepTime A limit on how long we may wait, expressed in playback time.

 \return OutputCoordinator status code, OutputCoordinatorNoError indicates success.

 bool KnownJump,
 unsigned long long ExpectedPlaybackTime,
 unsigned long long ActualPlaybackTime );
 \brief Spot, and handle, jumps in PTS values.

 This function is responsible for monitoring the playback times, and detecting large jumps in them.
 It will adjust the system time base when a jump is detected in a stream, and check that all other
 streams also replicate the jump at an appropriate point. If a stream fails to replicate the jump,
 then synchronization will be invalidated, and all streams will be invited to re-synchronize.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.
 \param KnownJump flag indicating that jump detection is not necessary, a jump is known to have occurred.
 \param ExpectedPlaybackTime The normalized playback time that is expected.
 \param ActualPlaybackTime The actual playback time seen.

 Rational_t *OutputRateAdjustment,
 Rational_t *SystemClockAdjustment );
 \brief Calculate output rate adjustments.

 This function is responsible for calculating the necessary adjustments to the output rates
 to keep the output in synchronization with master clock. If this is context refers to the master
 clock, this function also calculates the internally held adjustment to the system clock to
 keep it synchronized with the master output device.

 This function will (within the supplied context) maintain a history of expected durations and
 actual durations and will generate clock adjustments that are meant to lead to these being zero
 on an ongoing basis. Large differences relating to jitter or avsync issues will be ignored for
 this purpose.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.
 \param ExpectedDuration The time, in system clock ticks, that this frame was expected to take to manifest.
 \param ActualDuration The actual time, in system clock ticks, that this frame took to manifest.
 \param CurrentError The current error, in system clock ticks, between when this frame expected to manifest, and when it actually manifested.
 \param OutputRateAdjustment The value to be used as an output rate adjustment.

 \brief Adjust the base system time for playback/system time mappings.

 This function is provided to support audio/video synchronization, in order to hone the sync to
 within 3 ms (a period well inside the limit of control for a video display), it is necessary
 for a video stream to adjust the base system time, to force the audio to apply its finer grained
 controls to close sub field/frame synchronization gaps.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.
 \param Adjustment the adjustment, in system clock ticks, to be applied.

 \brief Check if the base system time for playback/system time mappings has been modified.

 This function is provided to support audio/video synchronization, allowing an
 output timer to find out if any adjustments to the base system time have been
 applied since the last call to this function.

 \param Context Stream context identifier.

 \brief Find the delay between the start of this stream and the earliest starting stream in the playback.

 This function is provided to support throttling of data injection into the player.
