Author : Nick

Implementation of the pure virtual class used to control the allocation
of portions of a buffer.

Note this is the simplest of implementations, it is definitely not the best
Note Allocations are returned as offsets from the base of the buffer
 (IE NULL == the base), this is because the allocator is used to allocate
 blocks from buffers that will have multiple address mappings (physical cached etc)
Note this implementation will not return a block of memory that crosses a 64Mb
 physical address boundary
