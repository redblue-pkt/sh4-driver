Source file name : osdev_device.c
Author : Daniel

Takes all the inline symbols in osdev_device.h and make them available
to the rest of the kernel as normal functions. This allows C++
applications access to these symbols without having to include the
Linux headers (which are not C++ safe).

Note that it is not possible to export all the OSDEV_ functions as
functions since some will break quite badly when un-inlined.
