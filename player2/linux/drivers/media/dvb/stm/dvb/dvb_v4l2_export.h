 * Video buffers captured from a LINUXDVB_* input will normally be in the
 * Y'CbCr _video_ range (either conforming to BT.709 or BT.601). They will
 * have been converted into R'G'B' colorspace by the hardware if the
 * application requested the driver to do so. That means the application will
 * get _video_ range buffers by default.
 * In addition, the hardware is able to scale the data to _full_ range
 * (identical to computer graphics). Therefore, applications which want the
 * data in _full_ (computer graphics) range will have to add this flag in the
 * VIDIOC_QBUF ioctl.
